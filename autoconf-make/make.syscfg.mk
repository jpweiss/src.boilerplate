# What this does:
#     -Wreorder: Make sure construction order matches declaration order.
#     -Wold-style-cast:  Warn if we use C-casts in C++ code.
#     -Woverloaded-virtual: Self-explanatory.
#     -felide-constructors:  Snip out temporaries created by the compiler
#                            (like in return values to the RHS of op=(), etc.)
#                            On by default in the present g++, but let's just
#                            make sure...

#     -Wno-deprecated:  Disable warnings about older, non-std-compliant
#                       G++-ism.
# May not work well with STL implementations (makes too much noise)
