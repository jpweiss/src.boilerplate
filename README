src.boilerplate
===============

My "source-code boilerplate", outlining my preferred coding styles.


When I start to write a new script, class, program, or whatever, I
begin by copying of one of these files.  They contain not only a
general-purpose layout for the source, but also contain "hints" to me
for what style I'm using with that particular language.


In other words, these files also illustrate the "coding-stylistics"
that I've developed over the years for the various programming
languages I've worked with.

What do I mean by "coding-stylistics?"  Think, for a moment, about
writing anything in English.  If you wanted your writing to contain
proper, formal English, you'd refer to Strunk & White's book, "The Elements of
Style," the bible of stylistics for good English.  Any decent software
developer will have their own "coding-stylistics" that they've
formed over the years.  Any software developer who's not a
Primadonna-Programmer will also be able to switch easily between their
personal stylistics and the coding standards they're required to use
at work.
